# Reservation Bot

An app that allows you to make reservations at your
favorite restaurant through text message.

TEXT FORMAT: first_name/last_name/datetime (please use military time in the datetime portion)
e.g. `Chris/Myers/January 17, 2019 14:31:00`

## Requirements
- [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) - a communications API we use for text messaging
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - a tool we use to communicate with the Twilio API when we're doing our local development.

## Setup
The setup is split in to two parts, one for the client and another for the server. The client lists all the successfully made reservations, and the server processes all the reservation requests.

#### Client
- enter the client directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to get setup.
- to start up the client run `npm start` and you should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **the client needs to be reloaded after each message to see new reservations!!! (fix coming soon)**

#### Server
- enter the server directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to get setup.
- add a .env file to your root folder with the following variables.

   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID - comes w/ twilio account` <br/>
   `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN - comes w/ twilio account` <br/>
   `TWILIO_NUMBER - get through twilio` <br/>
   `TEST_NUMBER - your phone number`

- to start up the server run `npm start` and you should be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

- also start your ngrok proxy and point it to the server with this command `ngrok http 3001`

- last, but not least you need to configure your ngrok proxy with your `TWILIO_NUMBER`, here's a [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/10/test-your-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok.html) to get that setup.

- **the route you want to hit locally must be matched when giving twilio the ngrok proxy route. <br />e.g.( localhost:3001/reservations -> foobar.ngrok.io/reservations)**
